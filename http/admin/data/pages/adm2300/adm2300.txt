===== What is Public Administration? =====
  - formal separation of politics and administration
  - bureaucracy general tasks: typology
  - leadership & public administration: who sets goals

**Bureaucracies** are the machinery of government that play a significant role in providing order and information (know what to do and act).

Periods of growth:
  - Absolutist
  - Shift to constitution-based forms
  - Development of administration: constitution-making process.

Start of Public Administration:
  - German and France scholars interested in machinery of government.
  - American scholars were concerned in regards to unitary states; ignited concerns over public administration.
  - U.K. - social scholars who believed in gradual reform of politics to improve people's lives.

Factors that caused increase of attention to Public Administration:
  - the raise of labour markets;
  - industrialization;
  - urbanization.

==== General Tasks of Bureaucrats ====
  - Regulate
  - Social welfare
  - Regional development

Tasks are shaped by public sentiment and paradigm of the policy choices.

**Does public leadership matter to public administration?**

__YES__
  * vision needs to be present in order to assess and achieve the goals;
  * strong character leads to the effective use of people, communication and trust.

__NO__
  * perception is everything in politics;
  * good and bad traits can be a matter of spin;
  * increased concern about managing crisises;
  * incompetent ministers;
  * complexity and size of bureaucracies make it difficult to determine who is responsible for what (even good leader does not know);

===== The Theories and Logic of Public Administration =====
  * public vs. private sector
  * structural-mechanics vs. organic-humanistic models
  * theoretical approaches to public administration

==== Public vs. Private ====
**Similarities of both sectors**
  * considerable size;
  * organized along hierarchy;
  * management defines, co-ordinates & directs resources towards the achievement of a set goals;
  * interact with multiple organizations;
  * organizational complexity;
  * manage relations with other organizations in order to achieve goals;
  * organizations can have multiple roles;
  * have finite resources (human and financial);
  * innovation is not given.

=== Features of the private sector ===
  * main goals in achieving a profit;
  * all efforts oriented towards making $$$;
  * private sector has competition;
  * short-term orientation (fiscal quarters);
  * profitability gauges success or failure;
  * private organizations retain managers who retain profits;
  * if firm goes under, it is taken over by other profitable firm(s);
  * rights do not exist in the private sector;
  * relationship is purely transactional (salesman are best friends until you have $$$);
  * managers and employees work towards profitability;
  * clear chain of commands;
  * consumers/clients who have $$$ are served, and even then service can be refused (i.e. Ferrarri's waiting list);
  * principle of property ensures that commercial secret is not subject to public scrutiny;
  * no interest is served beyond the firm's interest.

=== Features of the public sector ===
  * numerous goals due to the principle of serving to the public;
  * no competitors - states don't go under;
  * public services & goods meet the needs of the public as set out by an elected government;
  * success/failure is measured politically and administratively;
  * qualitative assessment of the public sector;
  * qualitative assessments depend on perspectives and on what is being measured: assessments are not absolute (ex.: people would complain about quality of services rather than the price of services being rendered);
  * no bottom line in public sector;
  * difficult to evaluate public sector;
  * economic considerations are not necessarily the primary concern;
  * transactional relationships ruled out by serving citizens with rights and obligation;
  * long-term orientation;
  * public sector is legally obligated to serve everyone - citizens have legal equality;
  * dysfunctional department/agency is the one that does not serve public well - it gets closed down, and another agency with different goals is opened instead.
  * population is __not__ tax payers - but citizens who enjoy formal legal equality;
  * controversies erupt when groups are being improperly served by the public sector;
  * public sector is legally accountable for its actions through freedom of information (FOI);
  * successful FOI requires agencies to disclose files;
  * messy chian of commands;
  * legal obligations and traditions require public servants to:
    * serve the public in a reputable manner;
    * treat their profession with respect;
    * promote the interests of the public service.

===== Roots of Bilingualism and Bicultiralism =====
  * Canada -> bilingual and bicultural country;
  * only French and English linguistic communities enjoy constitutional standing;
  * French Canadians were marginalized in business and government;
  * poor representation of French Canadians in the Public Service -> spoken English was required in order to enter senior positions;

  * women in the Public Service traditionally relegated to routine administrative positions;
  * pink-collar jobs;
  * equal pay for work of equal value :!:;
  * __women's work__ undervalued because certain positions have been traditionally filled by woman;

  * job requirements for both genders have been similar;
  * Canadian Human Rights Act, s.11 -> endorsed pay equity;
  * Ottawa refused to respect sec.11 until it was taken to court by ;
  * pay equity is now a matter that is negotiated during collective bargaining;

  * crown agencies recognized unions and participated in collective bargaining;

===== Parties to the Collective Bargaining Process =====
  * the Public Service Labour Relations -> employee bargaining units;
  * bargaining units are based on occupational groups and categories are recognized by Treasury Board and the PSC;
  * Treasury Board -> official employer for negotiating purposes and it is assisted by senior management from departments and offices;
  * certain categories of workers are not permitted to engage in collective bargaining;
  * Ottawa has designation power -> fewer strikes; -> bargaining units are prohibited from going to strike;

===== Choosing the System of Collective Bargaining =====
  * bargaining units may select an arbitrator track or a conciliation/strike track;
  * parties negotiate an agreement and a conciliator is introduced into the process whn negotiations become difficult;
  * conciliator -> assesses both parties' positions and advises them on how they can reach an agreement within 14 days of being appointed;
  * can't reach agreement -> third-party fact finder;
  * fact finder -> communicates with both parties, assess positions, and provides advice -> within 30 days + reports to PSLBR;
  * report is released within 15 days of being filed in order to encourage the two parties to reach an agreement;
  * public perception -> is a tool in public bargaining;

|  **Arbitration**  |  **Conciliation**  |
| parties asked to agree on as many issues as possible  | either party requests a conciliation panel  |
| remaining issues are presented to an arbitration board that is composed of each party's representative  | the panel's composition is formed by an arbitration board -> must report back in 14 days  |
| an arbitral award is handed out once decision reached | if no solution reached within 14 days -> go on strike  |
