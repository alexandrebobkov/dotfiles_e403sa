=== Budgetary Rationalism: PPBS ===
**links financial inputs to policy and program outputs**

**Planning-Programming-Budgeting System (PPBS)**
  * planning - developed based on established policy priorities and objectives;
  * programming - conceptualization of operational means to meet objectives;
  * budgeting - establishment of multi-year funding.
  * links strategic planning and prioritization with operational management concerns
  * problematic to set priorities across the government (each department can rationalize reasons for own priority)
