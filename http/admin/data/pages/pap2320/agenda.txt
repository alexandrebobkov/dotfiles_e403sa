====== AGENDA ======
**Agenda-setting** - recognition of a problem, issue, concern and demand by the government.

**Policy window** - favorable opportunity for agenda entrance based on the circumstances. There are 4 different types of windows.
  - Routinized - procedures dictate when window will be open.
  - Discretionary - window created by statement of politician.
  - Spillover - window that overlaps with already existing one.
  - Random - window that's caused by random act of nature. Ex.: crisis.

===== 5 Challenges of Agenda Setting =====
  - crisis-driven agendas;
  - delays until it is too late to solve the problem;
  - used as a vehicle of promises to gain votes;
  - may be more agendas than resources to process it;
  - agenda settings can be hijacked by interest groups.
