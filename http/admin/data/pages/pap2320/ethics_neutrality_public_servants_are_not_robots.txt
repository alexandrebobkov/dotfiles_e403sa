===== Ethics =====
**Public interest** is determined by elected politicians. Public servants safeguard it in accordance with the ethics of neutrality. The public interest is determined by Cabinet Ministers.

**Abolitionist**: public interest is the chameleon; mix of interests of many publics that is shape by own rational self-interest of officials.

**Preservationist**: what people see clearly; interest that contributes to the common good.

<sub>PRO</sub> Secrecy is an important element that allows responsible cabinet government work. Secrecy ensures fairness and equity in scenarios where revealing the information would cause the damage or bring the bias.

<sub>CON</sub> Secrecy reduces capacity to influence actions of governments. Accountability requires timely and complete information. Open information promotes trust for the government.

**Conflict of interests** - situation in which a public official has personal interest sufficient to influence objective exercise of official duties. Private interests conflict with public. A gain by virtue of the position in the public service.

  * **Real Conflict**
   - private interest exists
   - it is known to the public holder
   - interest has a connection with public responsibilities that are sufficient enough to cause the influence.
  * **Apparent Conflict** - conflict deduced from appearance of wrong-doing; indirect gain.
  * **Potential Conflict** - conflict that may develop into the __actual conflict__.

Public servants are not independent moral actors. Thus, value choices that public servants make depends on the organization they serve.

Does the organization corrupts morally right public servants, or vise-versa?

Theories of __Ethics of Neutrality__ and __Ethics Structure__ explain the moral responsibilities.

===== Ethics of Neutrality =====
* states that administrators are ethically neutral because they do not exercise independent moral judgement. Ideal administrator never injects personal values into the process, and thus is reliable. Therefore, it is the organization that corrupts morally and ethically sound public servants. Public servants project values and ethics of their organizations. However, in fact, public servants are independent professionals who can identify what is wrong or right.

===== Ethics of Structure =====
* the government is morally responsible because there are so many hands at work. So, no one person can be held accountable for particular policy. However, often it is possible to trace wrongdoings to the specific individual.

If both theories fail to isolate servants from moral responsibility, then moral __relativism__ or __absolutivism__ is determined.

**Ethical relativism** - there is no universal definition of right and wrong actions. Action morality depends on the circumstances. => Morality is based on social norms and values.

<sub>PRO</sub> allows cultural adaption; promotes tolerance; protects against tyrany.

<sub>CON</sub> misleading; based on belief of group of people; can't resolve all disputes.

**Moral absolutism** - standards of code conduct are absolute and never change. Standards are universal to all humanity.

<sub>CON</sub> Impossible to have all morals universal; there is no single morality; does not allow killing in sake of preventing more deaths.

**Utilitarianism** - right action is one that produces greater amount of good for the greatest number of people.

<sub>CON</sub> Difficult to compare good and bad in ethical dilemmas.

**Deontologism** - act itself is important, not consequences.
