  * what are the financial requirements? How do we spend the $$$?
  * no tax may be imposed, or no money can be spent without consent of Parliament;
  * __only authorized $$$ can be spent__;
  * control exercised at 2 levels:
    * Parliament must assent to all legislative measures. The House of Commons must authorize amounts and purposes of expenditure;
