===== Jan 14, 2016 Financial Cycle & Speech from the Throne =====
**Overview of the Financial Cycle** \\
**The Role of the Speech from the Throne**

__Budget__ - big fiscal plan. Documents relevant to budgeting are aligned along the budget cycle.

  * a parliamentary democracy system; a representative system of government;
  * bicameral federal system (where money builds (House of Commons ["common people'] ) & ;
  * Constitution Act 1867 -> Parliament: the Crown, the Senate and the House of Commons;
  * federal state -> lawmaking shared between orders of the government;
  * constitutional monarchy -> government os carried out in the name of the crown;
  * executive function -> Governor in Council (Governor General) acting on behalf of the Prime Minister and Cabinet;
  * __members of Parliament__ are elected, who then elect the Prime Minister;

==== Financial Procedures ====
  * the Crown is responsible for managing all the revenue (taxes, etc.); ~$290B/year
  * all revenues go to the Consolidated Revenue;
  * the Crown makes financial requirements of the government known to the House of Commons which authorizes the necessary taxes and "supplies" (grants of money);
  * what are the financial requirements? How do we spend the $$$?
  * no tax may be imposed, or no money can be spent without consent of Parliament;
  * __only authorized $$$ can be spent__;
  * control exercised at 2 levels:
    * Parliament must assent to all legislative measures. The House of Commons must authorize amounts and purposes of expenditure;
    * throughout review process and reporting, the House ascertains that no expenditure made that was not authorized;

  * income distribution tables -> based on analysis;
  * purchasing power of social classes -> money flow to the upper class;

  * speech from the throne -> aka framing the budget;
  * Budget -> high level fiscal plan & high level financial requirements
  * Appropriation stream -> Estimates system -> how much each sector needs? what are their requirements? 
  * Taxation stream -> changing the Income Tax Act in order to alter tax revenues; change in tax goes through legislation change since ITA is a law;
  * Public Accounts -> says how to spend the money -> can be used to assess how $$ were spent;
