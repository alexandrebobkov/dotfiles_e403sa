==== National Recognition ====
  * fundamental reality of politics in Canada -> historical coexistence of distinct national groups: Aboriginal, French, English;
  * :!: why learn our nations from within? -> complete & functioning societies with historic territories, languages institutions, cultures;
    - why national recognition is so important
    - how it is linked to territorial self-government 

==== Why Language of Nationalism Important? ====
  - __Strategic__ 
    * Standing -> international law; provides nationalism with political standing to support their law;
    * adds historical dimension to group claim;
    * differentiates claim from other groups -> allows to define self as a nation -> defend why should be treated differently compared to others (Ex.: Quebec and Ontario identity);
    * equalize bargaining power between majority & national minorities -> everybody must be seen as co-equal partner regardless of numerical majority (i.e. regardless that Ontario + Quebec make up 60% of population, the remaining population concerns must be taken into account on equal basis);
  - Non-Strategic
    * Sociology -> historical societies, institutionally complete, occupy territory/homeland, share distinct language, culture; territorial homeland -> non-debatable territory boundaries (rivers, mountains, etc);
    * power to name self -> one of most significant power sought by any group: respecting this group -> crucial test of respect

==== Quebecois Nationalism ====
  * pre-1960s: confederation of 2 nations = dualism (French & English came together to form Canada), "compact theory";
  * Public Policy Implication
    * closer adherence to terms of BNA Act along these lines -> BNA got to be respected, unless there were serious constitutional challenges; constitution couldn't be agreed upon for some period of time due to lack of understanding .... :?:
    * no demand for constitutional change (McRoberts, 1993, 119)
  * 1960s - the "Quiet Revolution" 
    * Adams ch.4; Resnick; Kymlicka; Gagnon; McRoberts;
    * "new nationalism" secularization -> dynamic interventionist state
  * Public Policy Implication - Demand for:
    * almost overnight QC abanded idea to allow churches run the lives (be the state)
    * QC -> rather than churches to run hospitals, etc -> the state should do so
    * QC -> primary promoter of French language -> therefore QC needed powers other provinces didn't have -> re-negotiate terms of BNA Act -> restructure fereralism (McRoberts, 2003, 91) => La Nation term became alive
    * QC -> people saw state of QC as primary protector of French language in Canada
  * since 1960s -> //new nationalism// -> new federalism
  * QC identified itself as a nation in Canada (not as province);
  * two-fold strategy -> form of federal autonomy + linguistic equality within federal government
  * implications: equality -> partnership of 2 nations (constitutional recognition of dual partnership)

==== Accommodating QC Nationalism: Canada's Experience ====
  - territorial autonomy
  - official language status for French
  - institutional completeness
  - => multinational federalism (Kymlicka, 2007a, p. 79) 

//provides a means of managing conflict while preserving peace, individual rights, democracy, and economic prosperity."// (p.80)
