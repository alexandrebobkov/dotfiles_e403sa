Kymlicka, Finding Our Way,  91-92, 110 \\

==== New Social Movements (NSMs) vs Old Social Movements ====
Old SMs: emphasis - common material interests
  * class-based (left-wing) common material interest
  * Social democratic ideology: (re) distribution
  * Commitment to electoral success
  * e.g. trade-unionism, farmer’s movements

NSMs: empasis - common identity & culture
  * Rooted in common cultural identity: sense of ‘self’
  * make demands on state, but do not seek to form governing party
  * e.g. peace, environment, rights (♀, LGBTQ, disabled)

Is this recognition essentially post-materialism?

Problem with “Old” vs “New”: Myths about Diversity:

1. False Dichotomy: Recognition vs Distribution
  * Recognition struggles not exclusively concerned with “identity” narrowly defined
  * Often involve struggle against exploitation, domination, inequality = redistribution
  * Distribution & Recognition are aspects of political struggles not distinct types of struggle - 
  * therefore study both aspects
  * economic justice: not subordinate, or at expense of reasonable identity-related differences


Kymlicka's Categories: Five Models of Ethnocultural Identity
  * What Can minorities do to protect identity, avoid marginalization?
  * How do they respond to majority nation-building?
    - Emigration to friendly state
    - fair integration (multiculturalism/ intercultruralism)
    - self-government (create their own institutions in their own language)
    - accept isolation/marginalization

Each of these (except #1) = different strategy that minorities adopt
  * success requires state accommodation
  * we find groups that fit in each category, not all want isolation.


What Can minorities do to protect identity, avoid marginalization? \\
//“Virtually all ethnocultural minorities…seek to participate in the modern world, and to do so, they must either integrate or seek the self-government needed to create and sustain their own modern institutions. Faced with this choice, ethnocultural groups have responded in different ways.”// (Kymlicka, "Five Models", p. 349)

Ethnocultural Groups/ Models of Ethnocultural Identity  
  - National Minorities
  - Immigrants  
  - Isolationist ethno-religious groups
  - Metics (e.g. Refugees)
  - Racial caste groups (African Americans)
  - Non-ethnic Identity Groups

1. National minorities (FOW, 29-31, 32-34)
  * What is a nation?
  * How nations respond to state pressures
  * How states deal with minority nationalism

1. National Identity, Nations, National Minorities
  * Groups formed complete, functioning societies, in historic homeland before incorporation in larger state
  * historic community, more/less institutionally complete with
  * territory/homeland, share distinct language, culture
  * sociology: people, culture (often co-defined)
    * substate nations don’t have state where they are majority, but maybe had/ sought such a state
    * Indigenous/ aboriginal peoples  - peoples whose traditional lands overrun by settlers; forcibly/ through treaties, incorporated into states run by people they see as foreigners

Politics:  reject pressure to integrate; seek recognition
  * self-determination, autonomy, independence
  * protect own separate societal cultures in modern state
  * how? Very difficult — Read: Kymlicka, Finding Our Way, 31-34

==== What is national identity? ====
Historical community, territory, homeland
  * More or less institutionally complete
  * Some shared aspects: distinct language, way of life
  * similar aspect(s) not shared by others
  * Territorial separation/ concentration (but not always)

Political demands/ struggle: distinct from ethnic groups
  * Seek separate self-governing distinct societies
  * asymmetry - separate societal cultures
  * autonomy (resist integration in majority culture)
  * See selves/ demand recognition or acknowledgment as: nation, historic society, a people
  * protect/ enhance separate institutions (not access to existing ones)

Nations, national minorities, national identity
“historically settled, territorially concentrated, and previously self-governing cultures whose territory has become incorporated into a larger state.” (Kymlicka, FOW, 30)

"...both substate nations and indigenous peoples have typically resisted state nation-building, and have fought to maintain or regain their own self-governing institutions, often operating in their own language, so as to be able to live and work in their own culture. They demand to maintain or regain their schools, courts, media, political institutions….To achieve this, they typically demand some form of autonomy. At the extreme, this may involve claims to out right secession, but more usually it involves some sort of regional autonomy. And they typically mobilize along  nationalist lines, using the language of ‘nationhood’ to describe and justify these demands for self-government.” (Kymlicka, “Five Models,” p. 350)

Nations, national minorities, national identity
Politics:
• Resist state privileging of majority
• Fight to maintain own self-gov institutions, operating in own language
• Demand to regain schools, courts, media, political institutions
How: either autonomy or independence
• Typically mobilize along nationalist lines
• Use language of nationhood to describe/justify demands for self-government
Typical majority response: "Suppression" (p. 351)
• Prohibit customs, strip language rights, ban language schools, impose literacy tests, outlaw political association,
• cultural genocide - residential schools
1. Empirical Mistake – evidence:
•  pressure to integrate national minorities won’t work
•  identities endure: heroes, myths, traditions change but sense of being distinct nation, with own national culture
• When state attacks: promotes, not reduce disloyalty
2. Normative mistake
• Why should nations not have same powers of nation building as the majority? (esp. those involuntarily incorporated?)
• burden/ proof: rests on those who deny nations same powers
• caveat: assume rule of law & rights
“In short, national minorities have typically responded to majority nation-building by seeking greater autonomy which they use to engage in their own competing nation-building, so as to protect and diffuse their societal culture….Indeed they often seek to use the same tools that the majority uses to promote this nation-building – e.g. they seek control over the language and curriculum of schooling in their region…the language of government employment, the requirements of immigration…the drawing of internal boundaries. We can see this clearly in the case of the Flemish or Québécois nationalism, which have been precisely concerned with gaining and exercising these nation building powers….”  (Kymlicka “Five Models” 350)

===== Lecture 3 - Jan 20 =====

  * demands for the national minorities are different -> they want laws to be protected
  * other minorities -> they don't want to be part of the society (:?:)
  * immigrants tend to typically integrate;
  * isolation groups -> don't want to (be excepted from certain laws);
    * in North America -> doing so would be fine; to other countries it would be hard to take this approach; Canada allows to do so under certain conditions -> for as long as there is no cause harm to others; in Canada it's ok to leave the community; there is a limit, however, on how many exceptions can be grated to the "special" society; Ex.: limits are drawn based on the grounds of humanity; degree of isolation typically gets limited.
    * reason in Canada there are tolerated differences -> groups practice their customs within the law;


=== Metics ===
__Metics__
  * denied right to be citizens
  * lived for the long time
  * group of people who are never given an opportunity to become citizens or residents;
    * irregular - illegal entry, illegal migrants, people who overstated their visas;
    * temporary migrants - seeking temporary protection, guest workers; initially not considered as long-term residents nor potential citizens;
  * guest workers

== Flawed Approaches to Metics ==
__Flaws__  
  * //Empirical// - unlikely to go home; danger -> permanently disenfranchised, alienated, racially defined underclass. Unrealistic to expect they will go back since they'll be married, have kids, etc. Home, even for refugees -> place they want to stay. It puts home society at risk -> by making permanent limitations on rights refugees would have -> societies would remain isolated;
  * //Moral// - not right to have long-term residents with no citizenship rights;

__Refugees__ - people who are forced to flee because they no longer could be safe at historic home.

__Read:__ Why take refugees? Why Canada should accept refugees? and other articles on BB.

=== Racial Caste Groups ===
  * like metics -> legally prevented from integration;
  * not like metics -> slaves;
  * not persons -> slave-owned property; not full human beings;
  * with citizenship, segregation until 1950s-60s; justified denial of integration
  * today -> pervasive informal discrimination;
  * compare with: nations, metics, immigrants;

__Models of integration that would work__
  - Interation - "I Have a Dream" Dr. M.L.K. -> dream of integration
  - Black nationalism -> separatism model -> Malcolm X
    * building own society, rules, institutions, etc;

  * in __some__ cases integration can be a solution to some extent; 
  *  both models aren't realistic (Kympicka). Instead -> varuety
  * Variety based on:
    * compensation
    * soecial integration
    * guarantee political representation
    * self-organization
    * accessible education

===== Lecture 4 - Jan 25 =====

"We have become so accustomed to our diversity that we often fail to notice how exceptional Canada is" (Kymlicka).
  * prosperous, tolerant, peaceful, free, democratic society, and
  * in on of the most ethno-culturally diverse countries on earth.
  * Ex.: government departments and top officials are comprised of many cultures
  * Canada is __exceptional__

Canada is a model, "world leader" of ethnocultural accommodation
  - ethnic/immigrant groups
  - indigenous peoples
  - sub-state nationalism

:!: not suggested that Canada is perfect in all regards, however Canada is not a country where large violence takes place.

Canada typically called bi-national according to early characterization.

**What Makes Canada __NOT__ Unique?**
  - Immigrant groups/religious minorities: multicultural citizenship
  - Indigenous peoples: nations, distinct societies with rights to self-gov't
  - Sub-state/minority nationalism: nations within states

**What Makes Canada Unique?** \\
1.  manages all 3 forms of diversity: (a) settles state (colonize historical territory), (b) multinational state (federation of two nations), and (c) polyethnic state (recognition of immigrants).

Canada: a+b+c :!: reason #1 \\
Belgium: b+c, no a \\
Australia: a+c, no b \\

2. Legislated and constitutionalized accommodation
  * Multiculturalism -> Constitution Act
  * Aboriginal & Treaty rights -> Constitution Act
  * Federalism & Official language rights -> constitutionalized

3. Canadian identity -> what does it mean to be a Canadian?

4. More successful 

**Is It Correct to Talk About Canadian Model?**
  * no distinctive logic;

What is Canadian model? Can it be exported/applied to/at other countries? 

===== Lecture 5 - Jan 27 =====
  * read Adams & Kymlicka //"Finding Our Way."// (especially the Introduction)
  * first 2 chapters of Kymlicka are somewhat disillusional; typical multiculturalism -> written around common arguments
  * Canada is recognized leader in multicultural policies and related success; Canada is managed to develop own model; 
  * read Adams -> what's common arguments against multiculturalism? Ex.: 
    - multiculturalism promotes separatism, discourages immigrants from integrating; either intended or willing to. 
    - it forces us to accept/tolerate ill liberal practices -> unacceptable cultural practices that violate charter of rights and freedoms. 
    - government should stay away from promoting ethics, gov't should be neutral on culture. 
    - immigrants are colonizers who want to change the things and accommodations (yes, it is so, but to the extent that immigrants want to enjoy same rights as everybody else does).
  * moral relativism -> Adam says that we shouldn't judge other people -> idea that ppl can't segregate what's right and what's wrong;
  * Kymlicka and Adams agree on the point of :?: :?: :?:

==== Responding to the Arguments ====
  * there is no evidence to support the claim that multiculturalism promotes separateness and impedes integration
  * in fact, evidence shows that policy works -> domestic and comparative evidence of integration.
  * proof that immigrant is integrated -> (ch. 2) -> economic outcomes (jobs) of ethnic groups/immigrants; marginalization of economic outcome;
  * degree of political engagement of immigrants
  * inter-marriage
  * feelings that immigrants have about Canada
  * engagement that immigrants have in Canada
  * ratio of immigrants willing to obtain citizenship, willing to become public servant
  * Adams (58) -> //"the most multicultural country on earth with the most favourable attitudes to immigrants."//
  * ethnic groups in Canada are more integrated than anywhere else -> as a result of policy in place
  * => multicultural policies have positive impact on integration

==== If that's so (multiculturalism policies make a difference), what explains this? ====
  - critics are ill-informed -> don't know that they talk about; not examining actual policies; attributing /inventing non-existing policies to explain non-existing trends; **policies are mean to integrate societies and create cooperation** -> Trudeau's speech; 
  - defenders are "strangely inarticulate" -> no clear explanation on how to evaluate policies success;
  - we have no clear sense of limits -> there are non-negotiable principles in Canada that cannot be compromised (ex.: criminal law) -> allowed to talk about limits (what policy can and cannot do);
  - => multiculturalism must be situated in broader context - not rejection of integration but "vehicle for adjusting the terms of integration." -> so it is a policy for integrating immigrants
  - real challenge is to define what a **fair integration** is :!:
  - -> policy that promotes certain accommodations

==== What explains misunderstanding about policies? ====
The idea that multiculturalism promotes ethnic separateness stems in large part ... from failure to see __how multiculturalism fits into this larger context of public policy.__ (Kymlicka //Finding Our Way// p. 24)

-> by not forcing there are larger chances of obtaining desirable outcomes/results.

==== What is multiculturalism? Response to majority nation-building ====
  * citizens define own identity -> under neutral gov't;
  * societal culture -> common culture -> states actively seek to integrate cultures into one
  * Ex.: Quebec -> one separate common culture, french-speaking; Ontario -> another separate common culture
  * state promotes societal culture
  * societal culture -> helps to understand distinction between nations and minorities
  * :!: when __nations__ are pressured to integrate -> traditionally resists -> seek rights for the form of self-governance -> they resist integration pressures and engage to form own nation building; Ex.: what was going on with Quebec
  * immigrants -> seek integration

**Mid-Term**
MC + keywords/concepts/definitions + very short answers (2 sentences)
Ex.: is there a Canadian model? Can it be exported?


===== Lecture 6 - Feb 1 =====

:!: REVISED READING LIST!!!

<WRAP center round info 60%>
**TEST FORMAT**
  - MC
  - T/F 5-6
  - keywords - identify word(s) or phrase
  - short essay - define concept in 2-3 sentences

Ex.: 2-3 points on why Canada should take refugees (was done so before as a big deal for Canada; Canada does so all the time).

</WRAP>

__Multiculturalism__ -> always existed beginning from discussion of preserving of human rights; multiculturalism protects human rights; context of freedoms, learning at least one of the language

Policy framework (pp. 185-186)
  - initial articulation - 1971 announcement
  - Constitution Act, 1982, s.27
  - further elaboration - 1988 framework legislation

:!: discussion started from the question //"How are we going to accommodate Quebec?"//, which lead to recognition of ethnic peoples in Canada (neither English nor French) -> multiculturalism word became introduced -> policy was implemented.

:!: Quebec doesn't want to be treated as ethnic group, but as __nation__ //which is why Quebec never accepted multiculturalism policy//.

Policy always existed in context of:
  * individual freedom of choice & preserving human rights (1971)
  * acquire at least one official language -> bilingual framework
  * willingness to share ideas, attitudes,..., values (1971)
  * ensuring equal treatment & protection under the law (1988)

Multiculturalism in practice -> meaning (pp. 40-41); -> policies provide integration; -> revise terms of integration.

Specific policies work to achieve goal (pp. 36-42) :!: refer to p.42 of the book
  - adapt/reform common institutions (#1 - #10) -> accommodate diversity within common institutions
  - transitional institutional separateness (#11 - #13) -> more complicated to assess: prevent or promote integration?

Do policies integrate, and are they fair?
  * marginalization of ethnic groups would occur if public sector workplace bans dress codes of particular ethnic groups.

==== Limits of Multiculturalism ====
  - Group rights: reject internal restrictions (p.62); accept external protections (p. 62) ->  limit vulnerability
  - Individual rights: multiculturalism provides external protections, not internal restrictions
  - Make limits explicit: obligation to uphold basic institutions (p. 65)
  - The need for a public debate: 2 tests fro group rights: external protection & individual freedom

===== Lecture 7 - Feb 3 =====
==== Race Relations ====
  - African Americans
    * why has integration proven so difficult?
    * compare with immigrants and national minorities 
    * where considered as second class citizens (were subject to discrimination)
    * was no intention to integrate them into mainstream society; in fact, intentions were to marginalize
    * not considered as national minorities since they were forced to separate
    * civil rights movement -> were promoting greater protection against separation; used immigrant model
  - Racial Dynamics in Canada
    * compare American Experience with:
      * long-settled black in Canada -> small fraction compared to new comers; presently, very few are long-settled since many are coming from abroad (i.e. to Montreal); Kymlicka -> admits that they face problems; earlier immigrants were able to overcome barriers;
      * recent immigrants - so-called "visible minorities"
      * concept of subliminal racism
      * how to prevent permanent marginalization

==== Changes in Social Understanding & Self-understanding ====
  * LGBT -> recognized as separate society
  * demanded to be seen as multicultural group (as opposed to medical affliction)
  * -> should we then include this group into separate ethnic group or culture (Kymlicka) :?:
  * disability? => but deaf people do not see themselves as deaf, as an example
  * LGBT -> people with their own culture, etc., just like any other culture
  * => why not attribute recognition to LGBT? 
  * => recognizing what's culture allows them to integrate into the modern world
  * :?: what models should we use? immigrant model? minority model? :!: read ch.5 to see the answer (hopefully I'll see)

:!: read chapter 5 of //"Finding Our Way"//

===== Lecture 8 - Feb 22 =====

Kymlicka ch.9 -> biggest thread to community stability -> political stability -> instability forces come from social minorities

:!: differentiate state from the nation \\
:!: allow to secede national minorities, and they will want to stay \\

=== State ===
=== Nation ===
=== Federalism ===
granting constitutionally protected realm of self-governance. Federalism divides central, sovereign power.
  * Asymmetrical/Non-uniform/Multinational -> doesn't look alike and has different areas of authority
  * Symmetrical/Uniform/Territorial -> Ex.: Canada; all provinces have same powers -> definition of symmetry; Quebec wants asymmetry in federalism; different states have different powers and controls

===== Lecture 9 - Feb 29 =====

  - state, sovereignty: existence of powers over a given population and within a given territory.
    * states have sovereignty
    * powers -> make laws over population; law enforcement; fiscal and monetary policies (issuance of money); international relations (other states recognize equality with other sovereigns); capacity to enter into relations with other states; 
  - nation, national identity: social groups that are conceptually distinct from states.
    * nation and sate are not synonymous; not all nations are states; state may contain many nations (Canada, India); some nations live in many states (Mohawk -> Canada & US; Innu, Kurds, Inuit).
    * nations are defined by the shared history; share distinct culture.
    * nations are pluralistic -> variety of religions, gender, societal culture, etc.
  - federalism
  - two models of federalism
    * territorial (uniform)
    * multination (asymmetrical) 

:!: what is nation? - on the final exam.

==== Multi-nation States ====
  * multi-nation state: single state containing national identities and powerful minority nationalism;
  * Canada contains internal minority nationalisms;

:!: multination state -> on the exam (Kymlicka, ch. 9, p. 128);

==== Multinational States ====
  * may occur:
    - involuntary -> invasion, conquest, colonization
    - voluntary -> different nations agree to form **federation** :!:
  * national identity may differ from citizenship (belonging to the state)

==== States and Nations ====
  * understand difference between nation identity and ethnic identity :!:
  * Quebec -> extraordinary success as a result of claims to nationhood;

==== National Minorities ====
  * fight to maintain separate self-governing societies;
  * use language of **nationhood** to express and justify struggle for self-government;

==== National Identity, Nations, National Minorities ====
  - First nations in Canada
    * never conquered -> instead, treaties were signed -> trade & military allies between nations & competing Euro states :!:
    * where treaty does not exist -> first nations have claim over their land;
  - Quebec (Resnick; McRoberts)
    * long history of self-government;
    * Quiet Revolution 1960s -> "new nationalism"
    * self-identity: nation deserving recognition
    * Francophones self-identity 1st Quebecois not
    * Canadian "nation" -> Quebec
    * **implications** -> constitutional recognition of dual partnership 

==== National Minorities. What can States do top Promote Unity? ====
  * nationalism -> one of the most important forces in the modern world -> Canada should take nationalism seriously (Kymlicka ch.9 approx.p128) => "natural way for self governance and power";
  * the real threat to Canada's long-term stability -> failure to reach a satisfactory arrangement with Canada's non-immigrant national minorities;
  * Quebec's debate: are we nation inside of Canada, or outside of Canada?
  * when national minority no longer wants to remain within the state -> fear builds up; forces demand creation of conditions to ensure unity of the state
  * concept of nation should be separated from state (Ex.: being Quebecois with Canadian citizenship)
  * => //national identity and national minority cannot be denied//
  * Resnick -> distinguishes 2 concepts: state and nation
    * //"... the only solution to the problems of multi-national federations like Canada lies in the __separation of the concept of nation from that of state__, in the recognition of the sociological reality of our __three nations within the territorial structure of a single state__.'// (195)

==== States and Nations. How to Manage Minority Nationalism? ====
  * How can we:
    - accomodate/protect national minorities, and
    - still hold multination state together? 
  * Are multination states doomed to disintegrate?
  * How do they manage in peaceful & democratic way?
  * Solution => Federalism
  * Federalism is precondition for accommodation -> federalism is essential ingredient for accommodation :!:

==== What is Federalism? ====
  - Unitary state: concenrated sovereignty
    * Simple Unitary State
    * Devolved Unitary State (devolution) -> power is assigned to cities/regions according with the laws
  - Federalism: divided sovereignty
    * Uniform federalism
    * Asymmetrical federalism 
  - Confederation: decentralized sovereignty
  - Anarchy: no central government
    * international system of sovereign states 
 
===== Lecture 10 - Feb 29 =====
==== ESSAY ====
  * read course outline :!:
  * 5 categories
  * page requirements (+/- several sentences)
  * introduction (simple; 1 sentence) + body (3 paragraphs?) + conclusion (repeat intro in past tense) -> check MLA guidelines p.37 :!:
  * Body:
    * good grammar
    * good organization -> logical connection between ideas and arguments
  * //something about chapter that shows that you can interpret; frame review as a memo to an elected official, or a public servant;//
  * :!: focus on ch.3 + general idea of multiculturalism in Canada; themes of the book (Canada is successful with multicultural policies) (by Adams)
  * ch.3 -> helps to understand concepts of multicultural policies
  * structure + syntax + organization + knowledge + critical evaluation (3 points each)
  * good writing -> prof must see it's good :!:
  * ability to analyse specific chapter

==== National Recognition ====
  * fundamental reality of politics in Canada -> historical coexistence of distinct national groups: Aboriginal, French, English;
  * :!: why learn our nations from within? -> complete & functioning societies with historic territories, languages institutions, cultures;
    - why national recognition is so important
    - how it is linked to territorial self-government 

==== Why Language of Nationalism Important? ====
  - __Strategic__ 
    * Standing -> international law; provides nationalism with political standing to support their law;
    * adds historical dimension to group claim;
    * differentiates claim from other groups -> allows to define self as a nation -> defend why should be treated differently compared to others (Ex.: Quebec and Ontario identity);
    * equalize bargaining power between majority & national minorities -> everybody must be seen as co-equal partner regardless of numerical majority (i.e. regardless that Ontario + Quebec make up 60% of population, the remaining population concerns must be taken into account on equal basis);
  - Non-Strategic
    * Sociology -> historical societies, institutionally complete, occupy territory/homeland, share distinct language, culture; territorial homeland -> non-debatable territory boundaries (rivers, mountains, etc);
    * power to name self -> one of most significant power sought by any group: respecting this group -> crucial test of respect

==== Quebecois Nationalism ====
  * pre-1960s: confederation of 2 nations = dualism (French & English came together to form Canada), "compact theory";
  * Public Policy Implication
    * closer adherence to terms of BNA Act along these lines -> BNA got to be respected, unless there were serious constitutional challenges; constitution couldn't be agreed upon for some period of time due to lack of understanding .... :?:
    * no demand for constitutional change (McRoberts, 1993, 119)
  * 1960s - the "Quiet Revolution" 
    * Adams ch.4; Resnick; Kymlicka; Gagnon; McRoberts;
    * "new nationalism" secularization -> dynamic interventionist state
  * Public Policy Implication - Demand for:
    * almost overnight QC abanded idea to allow churches run the lives (be the state)
    * QC -> rather than churches to run hospitals, etc -> the state should do so
    * QC -> primary promoter of French language -> therefore QC needed powers other provinces didn't have -> re-negotiate terms of BNA Act -> restructure fereralism (McRoberts, 2003, 91) => La Nation term became alive
    * QC -> people saw state of QC as primary protector of French language in Canada
  * since 1960s -> //new nationalism// -> new federalism
  * QC identified itself as a nation in Canada (not as province);
  * two-fold strategy -> form of federal autonomy + linguistic equality within federal government
  * implications: equality -> partnership of 2 nations (constitutional recognition of dual partnership)

==== Accommodating QC Nationalism: Canada's Experience ====
  - territorial autonomy
  - official language status for French
  - institutional completeness
  - => multinational federalism (Kymlicka, 2007a, p. 79) 

//provides a means of managing conflict while preserving peace, individual rights, democracy, and economic prosperity."// (p.80)

===== Lecture 11 - Mar 9 =====
==== Quebecois Nationalism: Reply to New Nationalism ====
  * reply to demand for federal bilingualism:
    * Pearson -> __Royal Commission__ on bi & bi 1963 - 1971
    * Trudeau -> 1969 Official Language Act
    * Constitution Act, 1982 16-20, 23 -> reaffirmed official languages
  * reply to demand for autonomy
    * NDP 1961, PM Pearson -> recognize
    * Trudeau: stubborn rejection -> any type of nationalism is a slippery slope for destroying Canada
    * Mulroney -> promised to accommodate Quebec values and interests
      * 1987 Meech Lake Accord -> proposed constitutional amendment to recognize Quebec as distinct society
      * 1992 Charlottetown Accord
    * :!: distinct society clause -> prevented Quebec to be recognized distinct society -> would potentially disintegrate Canada
    * Kymlicka -> responses: what's the best way to avoid disintegration of minority => to convince Quebec they are the nation in Canada much more than if they will be alone => convince they are better of in Canada

=== 2 Strategies ===
  - Redefine homeland of nationality
    * Trudeau - uniform federalism -> convince Quebecois are French Canadians, not as Quebecois; __however__, Quebecois see their homeland as Quebec, not as Canada -> perception of holeland got to be changed
  - Accomodate national minority
    * multinational federalism
    * treaty federalism 
    * => will give all powers and tools you need to ensure your identity gets protected and remains long-term
  * Trudeau -> make Quebec feel like others by making the other provinces like Quebec :!: __however__ Quebec didn't want others be like Quebec (i.e. bilingual); Trudeau only created anger of other provinces against Quebec since they were required to be bilingual -> poor Trudeau perception; Quebec __wanted autonomy__
  * Kymlicka -> Quebec's homelands cannot be changed -> French language got to be protected by the government

===== Lecture 12 - Mar 14 =====
==== Nations and Federalism ====
2 questions:
  * how do we accommodate national minorities, and
  * hold the multination state together?

Kymlicka (p.136), Resnick (1994a) McRoberts (2003) differentiate
  - Territorial federalism
    * ignores, downplays link between federalism & self-government
      * sub-central governments are:
        - region-based ("provinces", "states")
        - symmetrical, uniform (identical set of constitutional powers)
      * no accommodation: single nation
        - no self-government for national minorities
        - single-nation: redefine minority homeland: whole country, not just region within it
      * equality / non-discrimination = uniformity; all region-based governments - identical rights & powers; ex.: USA (Kymlicka, p. 136)  
  - Multinational federalism
    * emphasizes link

:!: McRoberts, in Rocher p. 103 quote

===== Lecture 13 - Mar 16 =====

==== Asymmetry: Impasse? ====
  - English Canada: single nation - federalism of territorial units
    * nation = Qc + FNs = all citizens sea to sea
    * equality = symmetrical provinces (see FOW, p. 141-143)
    * unitary idea of nation procedures asymmetry
    * different status = discrimination: gives QC "more rights"
    * // giving one province more power eliminates powers of other provinces => equality damaged//
    * :!: p. 132
  - Quebecois & Aboriginals: multinational federalism of peoples
    * special status demand: not more powers, but __national recognition__  
    * different federalism: recognize equal founding peoples
    * equality = non-uniformity, differential treatment (based on conception of what is essential)
    * identical powers to region-based + nation-based units => discrimination - deny equality to minority

Resnic -> Quebec needs to be recognized as a nation :?:  more important, __demand for recognition__-> sign that you respect people

:!: Seccession - Kymlica's argument as follows -> 2000 "Federalism and Secession" 13/2, 207-224.

===== Lecture 15 - Mar 30 =====
==== Self-Government & Treaties ====
  * agreements, even if once signed, are ongoing agreements, and subject to revision -> Treaties can be revised if there are problems
  * refer to the slide
  * after 1814 Europeans ignored treaties
    * population of Aboriginals declined up to 90% by 1867 ("Trail of Tears")

  * Europeans weren't equal when they arrived
  * Constitution Act 1982, s.35 defines Indians, Inuit & Metis
  * Indigenous people had governance system prior to when Europeans arrived :!:
  * ancestors wanted equality of relations (Treaty Federalism :?:)
  * :!: coexistence of Europeans and Aboriginals within the same territory -> Aboriginals agreed to for as long as they are recognized
  * Supreme court never recognized sovereignty of Aboriginals :!:
  * Aboriginals were considered as children (not as second-class society nor as minorities)
  * Aboriginals never wanted anything from Europeans, but in fact they anted to get back what they had initially

__Indigenous Government & Federalism Example__
  - Haudenosaunee Confederacy: 5 nations
    * socio-political entity established 1,000 years ago
    * 5 nations: Onondaga, Cayuga, Mohawk, Seneca, Oneida (later Tuscarora)
    * each of he nations ratified constitution based on 3 principles of Great Law of Peace
    * "a federal system of governance prior to the colonial occupation of the Americas" (Ladner 169) -> system existed prior to the occupation of Americans; indigenous had greater experience with federation system than Americans;
  - Blackfoot Confederacy (Western part of Canada/Alberta area) (Ladner, 170)
    * comprise of 4 nations 

=== Treaty Federalism ===
  * Abele & Prince quote, p. 139 -> "... the fundamental constitutional relationship between Aboriginal peoples in Canada and the Crown may be tracked back to the principles that governed the original contacts between Europeans and the people who inhabited the northern part of the continent..."; as well as Ladner, p. 172; Ladner, p. 178

**Treaty Federalism** -> coexistence of two sovereign entities within the same terriotory... (Ladner, p. 178)

== 2 Examples ==
  - 1613 Two Row Wampum Treary (Ladner 171 - 174)
    * Haudenosaunee & Dutch Government (New York) recognize equal coexisting sovereignty jurisdiction
    * non-interference, peace, friendship, respect 

Treaties didn't do (Ladner 178):
  * did not create one sovereign
  * did not recognize Crown as constituting superior government
  * did not alter exercise of self-determination is a specific geographic area

Treaties did:
  * "... an agreement between two independent powers that recognized the autonomy of each nation and the ability of each to determine their political status vis-a-vis the other."
  * created shared responsibilities not shared powers
  * territories - shared + exclusive, and
  * dual systems of law and government (Aboriginals recognized Europeans in exchange of Europeans recognize Aboriginals)
