====== FINDING OUR WAY ======
====== Chapter 4. The Limits of Tolerance ======
  * multiculturalism raises the question of the limits of tolerance -> does it require to tolerate the traditional practices of other cultures even if they are not acceptable in hosting culture?
  * => Canadians worry that the logic of multiculturalism will lead to acceptance of such practices
  * => Canadians have sense of insecurity about the limits of multiculturalism

===== 1. Individual and Group Rights =====
  * citizens are guaranteed common rights of citizenship: individual civil, political, and economic rights
  * ethnic groups today are demanding something more rights

==== Group Rights vs. Individual Rights ====
  * both rights protect the stability of groups

  - The right of group against its own members -> protects groups from destabilizing impact of internal dissent (i.e. individual who doesn't follow traditional practices) 
    * are inconsistent with liberal-democratic values -> i.e. restrict own members
    * seek to protect own culture rather than liberal institutions
    * => raises the danger of individual oppression  
  - The right of group against the larger society -> protects the group from the impact of external pressures (i.e. political or economic decisions made by the larger society)
    * does not rise problems of individual oppression
    * aim is to protect group's identity by limiting the group's vulnerability to the political decisions and economic power of the larger society
    * => are consistent with liberal-democratic principles

===== 2. Multiculturalism and Individual Rights =====
  * external protections
  * increase the access of immigrants to mainstream institutions, prohibit discriminatory conduct withing institutions, improves sensitivity to cultural differences, and provide services that the minority could not otherwise afford
  * immigrant groups do not have any legal powers over their own members -> multiculturalism does not grant self-governing powers
  * multiculturalism in Canada involves __external protections__, not internal restrictions
  * existing policies are intended to enable immigrants to express their ethnic identity, __if they so desire__ and to reduce some external pressures on them to assimilate
  * prohibits groups to violate individual rights, or to force members to practice practices
  * :?: to what limit?

===== 3. Making the Limits explicit =====
  * multiculturalism has limits -> human rights, individual freedom, etc.
  * multiculturalism must comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and freedoms
  * __however__ the federal government has never explained the limits to accommodation
  * => multiculturalism must guarantee basic individual civil and political rights

===== 4. The Need for a Public Debate =====
  * Canadians fail to raise the issue fearing that will be labeled racist or prejudiced
  * being a Canadian citizen entail __certain non-negotiable requirements__ -> respect for human rights, democratic values
  * sometimes, counterproductive -> hijab debate in Quebec -> was this practice really non-negotiable one :?:

===== 5. Conclusion =====
  * group rights are incompatible with individual right and social equality **__BUT__** -> groups must promote equality, and respect freedom of individuals within each group
  * => do not oppress other groups nor members within each group
  * => multiculturalism passes both tests mentioned above, provides grounds for fair integration & truly consistent with liberal-democratic values

====== Chapter 5. A Crossroads in Race Relations ======
  * integration is always a two-way street
  * it requires a willingness on the part of the minority group to adapt to certain features on the part of minority group to adapt to certain features of the mainstream society
  * it equally requires a willingness on the part of the majority to accept the minority as equal citizens
  * => work co-operatively alongside members of the minority

===== 1. Race in the U.S.: The case of African Americans =====
  * faced specific kind of discrimination
  * operated alongside a kind of societal integration
  * were not seen as persons
  * were given total institutional segregation, African Americans had no choice but to develop their own separate society => experienced impact of desegregation
  * => were closer to the national minority pattern (immigrants & refugees) than the immigrant pattern
  * __however__, didn't choose to separate themselves from mainstream institutions :!: -> most wanted to integrate to mainstream society

===== 2. Visible Minorities in Canada =====
  * American Blacks lived in fully segregated society from top to bottom -> had its own Black universities, businesses, layers, etc. __VS__ in Canada -> most Blacks regardless of skills, tended to fit into one level of society - the bottom
  * the only way for Blacks to participate in modern life in Canada was through inclusion in the mainstream society

===== 3. Towards a Multiracial Society =====
  * stereotypes about Blacks
  * red-necked racism -> belief that one race is genetically superior to another
  * polite racism -> avoid saying belief in public
  * Blacks who ended up being successful in society perceived to become white
  * Black separatism is off-base in Canada -> Canada has no history of Black universities, etc.
  * => promotes success of Blacks in mainstream
  * whites are willing to pay a price to promote racial equality

===== 4. Conclusion =====
  * visible minorities can follow the same pattern of integration as earlier immigrant groups
  * race relations became important goal of the federal multiculturalism policy (Canadian race Relations Foundation, Oct 1996)

====== Chapter 6. Can Multiculturalism be extended to Non-Ethnic Groups? ======
  * disadvantaged groups seek public recognition of their distinctive identities and needs
  * also, seek certain forms of group-specifi rights
  * seek freedom from discrimination in the exercise of their common rights
  * seek goups-ecific forms of recognition and participation
  * => social group can be excluded or marginalized from mainstream society

===== 1. New Social Movement as Identity Groups ======
  * gays/lesbians and deaf -> define themselves in cultural terms
  * view themselves as quazi-ethnic -> share common identity, history and way of life
  * what makes them different is that __they share common identity__ (other groups share common interests)
  * these groups do not seek to form a governing party
  * gays claim that they are as much cultural group as many ethnic groups
  * shift from medical definition to a cultural definition
  * similarly, deaf people -> new ethnic group with separate language

===== 2. Should Multiculturalism Include All Cultural Groups? =====
  * mentioned groups are not entirely ethnic since they do not share same ethnic descent, but certainly are cultural
  * some argue that gays/lesbians form distinctive national identity
  * as an example, such identity used to fight homophobia wherever it occurs
  * however, lesbians/guys associate themselves with national culture they were born into
  * they seek fair accommodation within mainstream institutions, which makes their demands similar with ethnic groups
  * however, the ethnic model may not be sufficient for them
  * => demand protection from discrimination, demand public affirmation of their identity
  * => demand own separate social culture
  * deaf group is closer to the immigrant model of integration
  * Deaf -> quazi-national group

===== 3. Conclusion =====
  * although existing multiculturalism policy has its limits, it offers insights about the requirements of social integration
  * fundamental issue -> lack of fair terms of integration
  * multiculturalism in Canada  provides coherent framework for fair terms of integration for immigrant groups -> as well as national minorities and quazi-nations
  * recognition should be all-inclusive and accept identities and practices of greater public
  * multiculturalism -> large struggle to build tolerant and inclusive society
