====== FIVE MODELS OF MULTICULTURALISM ======

  * nation-building affects minorities -> Taylor: nation-building privileges members of the majority culture
  * each group claims specific injustices that majority nation-building has imposed on them

Members of minority cultures face a choice:
  - emigrate
  - accept integration into the majority culture
  - seek the sorts of rights and powers of self-government
  - accept permanent marginalization -> be left alone on the margins of society

=== 1. National Minorities ===
  * groups that formed complete and functioning societies in their historic homeland prior to being incorporated into a larger state (by conquering or overrun); typically resist state nation-building and demand to retain own cultures and state
  * can be divided into:
    - sub-state nations -> do not currently have a state in which they are a majority, but may have had. Ex.: Quebecois.
    - indigenous peoples -> whose traditional lands have been overrun by settlers, and who were forced to be incorporated into states run by foreigners. Ex.: Inuit
  * national minorities respond to majority nation building by seeking greater autonomy which they use in own nation-building
  * historically, national minorities were suppressed; distinct national identity eliminated;
  * suppression is wrong -> for normative and empirical reasons
    - empirically -> evidence simply shows that pressuring national minorities simply does not work
    - normatively -> hard to support suppression; if majority can engage in legitimate nation-building, why not national minorities?

=== 2. Immigrant Groups ===
  * formed by __voluntary decision__ of individuals  and families to leave their original homeland and emigrate to another society
  * two categories of immigrants:
    - have the right to become citizens -> under immigration policy
    - do not have such a right -> under work-permit policy
  * unlike national minorities, this group accepts integration into larger society
  * typically territorially dispersed

=== 3. Isolationist Ethnoreligious Groups ===
  * small immigrant groups which voluntarily isolate themselves from the larger society, and avoid participating in politics or civil society; avoid all contact with the modern world
  * voluntarily wave their citizenship
  * response to majority nation-building -> seek exemption, avoid civic obligations to the rest of society
  * majority nation-building tolerates these groups so long as they do not harm people inside the group

=== 4. Metics ===
  * never given the opportunity to become citizens -> irregular migrants, visitors, foreign tourists
  * if lived for many years -> can change mind and remain in country
  * response of metics -> obtain permanent residency to gain access to citizenship
  * response of majority nation-building -> amnesty programmes to grant citizenship to those who overstayed their temporary visas

=== 5. African-Americans ===
  * descended from the African slaves brought to the U.S.
  * were not seen as citizens
  * granted citizenship rights, but remained to segregation laws
  * like metics -> cannot have citizenship, __however__ their migration was justified -> were brought to country for slavery
  * unlike metics -> this groups was prevented from integrating into the institutions of majority culture
  * => do not fit voluntary immigrant pattern
  * => raise a complex circumstances
  * suffer the greatest injustices of all ethnocultural groups
  *
