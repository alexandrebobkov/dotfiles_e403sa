__Team:__
  * e-mail member's list to prof & proj. coordinator;
  * define team leader (not necessarily);

  * no control over usage of the project once it's delivered;
  * projects end usage may be different from the intended;
  * define what's to be delivered;

__Project__ - temporary endeavor undertaken to create unique product/service or result. Typically, project involves a problem that has to be solved.

__Project management life cycle:__ Design phase (project initiation) -> Planning -> Implementation (sign-off of project charter :?:) -> Termination (asking to sign-off project approval).

Design & Implementation pick up slowly -> details are to be negotiated with the client;
Completion stage is also slow. Project costs are at their maximum during primary stage of carrying out the project work (peak carrying out of work);

Cost of changes vs. Stakeholder influence get inversely related towards completion of the project; i.e. it is more costly to change project towards its completion, but stakeholder has higher power over changing the project at its beginning, and vise versa.

It is advised to have stakeholders/clients during project discussions. __Communication is critical__ :!:

Change management -> sometimes organizations go through the change during project implementation. Ex.: reallocation. Communication __is a key__ - not only project implementation has to be communicated, but also its consequences.

Project failure can be reduced through project management experience.

__ Triple Project Constraints __
  * time -> activities & sequence
  * budget -> cost break-down
  * scope -> define what the scope is

<WRAP group>

__Project Management__ \\
(Activity Costing; Custom)
  * unique
  * temporary
  * cross-functional teams
  * unique outcome
  * budgets are set-up differently than program budgets
</WRAP>

<WRAP half column>
__ Program Management__ \\
(High Volume Production)
  * repetitive
  * on-going
  * wider focus
  * daily routine operations that do not require detailed documentation
  * budgets remain the same with slight differences

===== Lecture 3. Jan 26, 2016 =====

**Why do Projects Fail?**
  * lack of communication;
  * last-minute decisions;
  * poor planning;
  * lack of sensitivity to people's needs;
  * lack of patience;
  * lack of necessary resources;
  * document the changes in project plan;
  * lack of clearly defined project;

**Project Identification**
  * internal & external factors;
  * objectives (reasons for the project -> improve service; reduce cost, etc.)

**Project Feasibility**
  * cost, time, and quality considerations
  * involves assessment of large amount of data
  * financial resources
  * geographic location -> affects how easy it is to obtain required resources
  * time, technology & resources -> affects the "window" available for project implementation
  * :!: any conflicts with other resources at the organization?

//Feasibility study// -> an analytical study to determine the ability to do the project. Its objectives is to assist with decision to implement the project or not.

^  INTEREST  ^  POWER  ^
|  |  LOW  |  HIGH  |
|  low   |  monitor  |  keep informed  |
|  high  |  keep satisfied  |  manage closely  |

**Stakeholder Analysis**
  * identify their interests
  * analyse stakeholders based on: interests, assumptions & risks (lesser importance), estimated project impact (degree of influence on the project).

//Stakeholders// -> project managers, sponsors, core project team, functional manager, and other (internal clients, suppliers, contractors, P3 partnerships).

__Ways to build strong relationships with client__
  * be open and honest
  * make lunch meetings

//Project Charter// -> agreement between two parties outlining info about implementation of the project. Document gets circulated back and forth between parties until signed/agreed upon. 

Project charter has to have precise scope statement -> narrative description of what needs to be accomplished by the project

  - Determine Need -> meet with the client

===== Lecture 4. Feb 2, 2016 =====

==== Work Breakdown Structure ====
  * INPUT = Project Charter -> defines WBS
  * reasons why to use WBS;
  * allows to monitor, measure and control work;
  * visualizes work to be done;
  * integrates scope with time and cost; (how :?:)
  * helps to identify budget;
  * improves future projects;

==== Project Life Cycle ====
  - Create
  - Refine
  - Use
  - Verify

**Critical Path** - a sequence of activities in a project that takes the longest time to complete.

**Compressing schedule** - find ways to reduce the total duration of the project to meet delivery deadline.

**Resource leveling** - used to ensure that the project schedule can be accomplished with the resources available.
  * Strategies to level:
    - outsource the services/tasks

**Slack** - amount of time available before task must be started.

//When have several activities that finish at the same time, and need to pick the one you should complete://
  * Compare resources
  * Take completion date into consideration

** A Team ** - a group of people with shared objectives and processes with complementary skills, knowledge, and exercises.
  * project expectations: objectives & benefits
  * people expectations: values

Factors that affect communication and tone within the team:
  * cultural backgrounds
  * interests
  * competencies
  * personalities
  * interests

^  Characteristics of High-Performing Teams  ^^
|  Task-related qualities  |  People-related qualities  |
| * commitment  | * work interests  |
| * result-oriented  | * capacity to solve conflict  |
| * willingness to change  | * good communication  |
| * concern for quality  | * mutual trust :!:  |
| * ability to predict trends  | * self-development of team members  |
| * ability to anticipate problems  | * effective organizational interfacing  |
| * synergism | |

Factors contributing to cooperation:
  * superordinate goals
  * rules and procedures
  * accessibility - ability to approach and interact with each other
  * psycho-social outcomes
  * physical proximity

==== Four Phases of Team Development ====
  - Forming
  - Storming - communications and problem resolutions
  - Norming - executing the work plan and achieving
  - Reforming - 
  - Performing - re-calibrating expectations

=== Barriers to Team Development ===
  * role conflict
  * communication problems
  * dynamic project environments
  * lack of team definition and structure

===== Lecture 11. Apr 5, 2016 =====

==== Change Management Awareness ====
**Pierre Martineau**

  * probability of success
  * Kotter, Ackerman-Anderson

=== Project Checklist ===
who's in charge of what? \\
external resources become internal ones via integration/communication process \\
outcome mapping - similar to logic model; used for items that cannot be quantified; \\
community letter engagement -> write behaviors description for scenarios that cannot be quantified; \\
project -> is a change\\
resistance is inherent to the project management; change causes resistance

__Project Management Summary Checklist:__
  - client's implicit needs
  - environment and stakeholder analysis (SWOT?)
  - governance structure
  - time frames
  - HR requirements
  - risks tolerances - personal characteristic
  - schedule
  - budget
  - performance management/measurement system -> what get's measured get's managed
  - involvement & communications 

__To get results__ \\
Define -> Measure (implement measurement system to control process) -> Manage (control loops) = RESULTS + Tell your Story (show what was done)

Symptoms of delay of change: reduced performance and involvement.
Culture = people + organizational practices learned over the course of time. \\
Strategic plan to deal with a change ->  compare/match the objectives of the project \\

Strong driver for change -> negative external outcome (change -> tendency to avoid it); __good crisis__

Risk management -> maximize likelihood of project success using limited amount of resources & avoiding waste of resources (i.e. identify target); arbitrage between resources and needs.

High speed projects have higher rate of failures and errors; avoid delays and procrastination.
