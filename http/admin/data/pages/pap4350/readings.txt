==== 5 Stages of Project Management ====
  - Initiation
    * selecting the optimal project under given resource limits;
    * preparation of the documents to start the project;
    * assigning responsible person.
  - Planning
    * defining the work requirements, quality and quantity of work, and required resources;
    * scheduling activities & evaluating risks. 
  - Execution
    * directing and managing the work. 
  - Monitoring & Control
    * tracking the progress by comparing actual performance against planned;
    * analyzing variances and impacts;
  - Termination
    * verifying the completion of the work;
    * closure of associated documents;

**Project Success** - completion of project within:
  * time, cost, desired performance, prescribed use of resources, acceptance by the client, as well as;
  * minimum change in scope of work, disturbance, and affect on the organizational culture.

**Project Management** - planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of company resources for an objective that has been established to complete specific goals and objectives.

Project management utilizes vertical and horizontal hierarchy.

==== 5 Functions of Management ====
  - Planning
  - Organizing
  - Staffing
  - Controlling
  - Directing

==== 3 Project Constraints ====
  - time
  - cost
  - performance

//Project manager controls resources on a given activity within mentioned project constraints.//

**Project deliverables** are project outcomes that can be measured (possess tangible properties).

==== 6 Categories of Resources ====
  - Money
  - People
  - Equipment
  - Facilities
  - Materials
  - Information Technology

<WRAP center round important 60%>
Project managers negotiate the use of resources with line managers since later ones have control over them.
</WRAP>

Project managers work with the functional managers, whose roles are:
  * define __how__ the task will be done, and __where__;
  * provide sufficient resources to accomplish project's constraints;
  * provide deliverables;

In other words, //project managers// __identify the requirements__ for the project, while the //line managers// __identify technicalities__ of the project.

Projects can be classified by the levels of:
  * skills required;
  * conflict intensity;
  * control;
  * planning.

===== Top Reasons Projects Fail =====

  - Annoying Senior Management
    * uncertainty about project performance;
    * possess specific experience; \\ __**-> SOLUTION**__ 
    * provide reports that contain __information asked by management__;
    * set up a review schedule;
    * plan in advance; 
  - Unrealistic Schedules \\ __**-> SOLUTION**__ 
    * produce work breakdown structure and network diagramming;
    * produce impact analysis;
    * determine critical path or amount of time required for completion; 
    * crash or fast track tasks -> add resources, multitask, loosen scope of work.
  - Underestimating the Impact of Changes \\ __**-> SOLUTION**__ 
    * extension of time, cost or reduction of scope of work compared to one originally required;
    * know cost-time-scope relationship;
    * involve all stakeholders in planning the project;
    * communicate info on changes to all stakeholders; 
  - Unclear Scope of Work \\ __**-> SOLUTION**__ 
    * create detailed scope description and have it formally approved;
    * for long-duration projects -> assess work at each milestone;
    * ask client their expectations in details; 
    * require management to sign-off changes in scope;
    * check customer satisfaction during the project;
  - Lack of Risk Management \\ __**-> SOLUTION**__ 
    * make a list of all problems the project team had in the past;
    * eliminate potential risks before they occur;
