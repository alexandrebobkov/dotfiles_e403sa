Q: should there be a public service charter?

  * future of public service with new government -> huge differences to come; some institutions were treated badly/caused bad working conditions;
  * how to determine what's wrong and what's right;
  * how to deal with discrete decisions;
  * balance between rules, values, and norms;

what is responsibility? moral view & judgement? role of public interest in that? and, what is it? what's the source of values & perspectives on the issues? what's the role of individual in org'n, and degree of responsibility in org'n?

__personal responsibility:__ **reasons for having** individual moral responsibility; how and what's done in organization? or, no responsibility -> just a piece of machine. 
View: lack of responsibility is not logical; p.s. mush be responsible; must advice on policies -> what gov't should do on the issue -> can't do that well/effectively unless there is own ethical prospective; how could you advice without having own view on that? 

Once you've given an advice -> responsible to carry out advise; decision to make -> involves issues of greater or lesser work;

At various points in career got to make decisions what lines cannot be crossed -> not moral -> got to do something about it -> once faced -> implications of judgement is never enough to just follow the orders -> can still be criminal responsible (i.e. WW2 can't do just because was given order); **will be moments when you have to make decision what action to take** small action, or serious (disclosure of wrongdoing); make authorized or unauthorized (law/against the law) -> law sometimes is not ethical -> might have to break one -> legal unethical vs. illegal ethical;

Recognize that public servant has moral responsibility to make judgement;

Also, got to do so just to run own company/be manager -> work will have ethical and moral dimension to it.

Leading organization will have personal ethical dimension to it. Ex.: when you file travel expenses -> is it honest/complete? purely personal dimension.

**for all above lists reasons why no public servant don't have be ethical; public servant works for people of Canada -> accountable for public interest to some degree**

==== Public Interest ====
__prospective:__ central concept of public organization; public interest is justice; p.i. is interesting concept -> cannot be clearly defined -> critical, but cannot say what it is in a certain sense.

Auditor report asked to define public interest -> similar to trying to define justice or good.

#1) Public interest guides all actions in public sector. Best way to look for it -> what's the range you're accountable for? what's the scope? are you limited to one set of interest, institution, society? business angle? environmental angle?

narrow range -> decision doesn't reflect public interest, but personal interest;

#2) what's the range in quality of values? got to make trade off -> how to do that? what values to trade? are they highest type (i.e. justice, mercy, etc.)

#3) who makes the decision -> who has legitimacy for decision? No such -> no public interest

#4) do conditions for judgement of public interest exist?

public servants are human beings -> cannot be asked to be superheroes -> only asking to make the best informed judgement; cannot just go and say it's great idea -> got to test idea against best expertise, knowledge, etc.

==== Question of the Source ====

//from where do you draw info to make decision?//

what sources were used to make ethical decision? //continuum of ethics//: 1) own personal values and important things for us; essential norms and values inherited from ancestors, parents, family, etc. 2) organizational values and ethics -> organization's own values and ethics prescribed for the members of the organization; got to pay attention to them as they may affect personal values; 3) societal values -> consensus of the society/country at a given time about public goods.

public servant got to commit to particular set of public values; dialogue between personal and organizational values;

there can (will) be tensions between societal and organizational values (as between org'n and personal ones).

professional values -> own set of values (codes) -> accountants -> professional values sometimes intention with other values; 

risky places -> tension between organizations and professions (recall the last workplace);

**values and ethics are not purely individual matter in many ways because of the continuum values mentioned above; what shapes individual values -> organizational cultures withing which individuals work -> org'n will shape conduct of individual; values of newly hired individuals will be shaped by the organization ->**

**future public service must have emphasis on organizational dimension of values and ethics ('cause it's organizations that shape people)** how to create leaders who are role models -> employees respect and imitate -> how to ensure organizational climate to hold managers accountable for creating workplace that promotes ethical workers.

**// know who you want to become; beacon for the future self. //**

code -> accountable to comply with -> can be used as defense to justify actions -> hold onto; be proud of;

duty of loyalty -> not to diminish reputation of organization in public; resolve issues internal!

in a public interest to have public servant who carries interest of government -> public servants of Canada to carry interests of elected government -> can't alter policies based on own views.

public servants have to be self-censor -> cannot / shouldn't discuss in the public (to save reputation of organization; comply with secrecy / confidentiality).

scientific research -> report -> policy decision (different areas; scientists do not decide policies).

7. ethics
6. values/virtues
5. organization
4. leaders (role models)
3. management (systems to carry out practices; often in conflict with values)
2. institutional and legal framework (public service employee act; disclosure/protection act)
1. governance (adequate system of political institutions; independent courts, police, press)

if you want to have what's on the top, you've got to have good foundation (i.e. to fight corruption, which rests on the top, got to reform the foundation, i.e. governance)

=> challenge to achieve ethics is huge

what's humanity? what makes human being? -> good behaviors; 4 categories

organizations are only as good as their leaders -> leaders define organizational environment
