After reading chapter on political neutrality of public servant (The Responsible Public Servant by Kenneth Kernaghan) and additional reading by Benoit, I have come to the conclusion that the assessment of public neutrality of public servants is the complex process. Clearly, political neutrality is necessary for maintaining objectivity of public servants. However, at the same time, political neutrality can infringe the freedoms of expression of political servants, or affect objectivity of public organizations, depending on the degree to which political neutrality is given.

According to Kernaghan, political neutrality is the impartiality of administrators in political issues. In other words, public servants are expected not to take any side of political discussions. Furthermore, political neutrality requires "that public servants do not engage in activities which impair-or appear to impair-their ability to carry out their official duties in a politically impartial manner" (Overeem). 

Historically, political neutrality has been a central feature since Confederation. It is a constitutional convention by which public servants should avoid activities that are likely to affect political impartiality (Kenneth p.101). Political neutrality is written down in a number of official documents, including //"Accountable Government: A Guide for Ministers and Ministers of State"// and //"Public Service Employment Act (2003)"//.

The model of neutrality addresses the issues of political neutrality, but in the idealistic terms. As a consequence, this is not entirely applicable to the real issues. However, the model of neutrality can be used in order to assess and identify the areas where political neutrality is being affected.

Author has raised arguments that support and reject the model of neutrality. In my opinion, the given model is important to the extent that it ensures that public servants are appointed and promoted according to the merit. This approach ensures that public sector employs knowledgeable, educated, and reliable professionals.
