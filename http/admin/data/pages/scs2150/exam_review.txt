====== EXAM REVIEW ======

===== Sampling =====
  * 3 factors in identifying a population
  * advantages of sampling
  * 3 factors influencing the representatives of a sample

__Population__ - the group that we wish to study.

__Sample__ - a smaller group that is representative of the population. The statistical analysis of sample allows to form generalizations about population as a whole.

==== 3 FACTORS THAT IDENTIFY POPULATION ====
  - Unit of analysis (who?)
  - Geographic location (where?)
  - Time period (when?)

==== ADVANTAGES OF SAMPLING ====
  - Efficient
  - Cheaper
  - Restricted to time frame
  - Less data collection and entry
  - Accurate estimate of population

==== 3 FACTORS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF SAMPLE ====
   - Accuracy of the sample time frame
   - Sample size (larger sample -> lower error)
   - Sample selection method

//weakness in any one element cannot be compensated by another//

==== 4 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE SAMPLE SIZE ====
  - Homogeneity: highly homogeneous -> smaller sample is needed
  - # of variables under study: more variables -> larger sample is needed
  - Sampling method
    * Simple Random Sample
    * Stratified Sample
    * Cluster Sample

Cluster (low accuracy) -> Simple -> Stratified (high accuracy)

==== QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH ====

=== 1. Simple Random Sampling ===
//Cases (samples) are randomly chosen until the desired sample size is met.//

//Ideal method. Each element has an equal chance of being selected. However, costly for large population.//
=== 2. Stratified Sampling ===
//__Breaking__ population into __mutually exclusive subgroups__ and then randomly sampling each group. Increases homogeneity of the samples and reduces sampling error.//

//Ex.: group by political party, then sample. Group schools into urban and sub-urban.//
=== 3. Cluster Sampling ===
//Dividing the population into a smaller number of small subgroups (clusters), and then randomly selecting clusters.//

//Yields high sample error.//
==== QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ====
=== 1. Purposive Sampling ===
The most common sampling strategy. It groups participants according to __research question__ or pre-selected criteria.

Sample size is not always fixed. It grows until additional data is no longer brings additional insights.

Purposive sampling is most successful when data collection is done in conjunction with data review and analysis.
=== 2. Quota Sampling ===
Stipulates number of samples with different characteristics (i.e. age, place, class, etc). Groups participants according to __characteristics__. Useful when group is rare. Weak because it is not random. However, cheap and fast.
=== 3. Snowball Sampling ===
Recruits sampling of "hidden populations". Ex.: ask participant to refer to his/her social networks.

==== QUAL vs. QUANT ====
^  QUAL  ^  QUANT  ^
| sample method depends on research objective & characteristocs of population.  | sample method depends on margin of error.  |
| no generalization; non-random  | represents population  |

===== Observation =====
//integral part of the research process.//

^  +  ^  -  ^
| Observation research is useful to develop a familiarity with a cultural mileau.  | It is time consuming. Difficult to document the data. Involves subjectivity.  |
| Participant observation is useful for gaining an understanding of the following: a) context (sociological, cultural, social); b) relationships between people; c) behaviors and activities.  | :::  |
| Observation may uncover important factors that were unknown when the study was designed. Observation may help to design questions to better understand subject studied, or to improve design. | ::: |

=== 2 TYPES OF OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH ===
  - Direct Observation - observe from beside. Note behaviours and categorize.
    * covert (aware)
    * overt (blend-in)
  - Participant Observation - become part of community. Allows for greater understanding of context.

__**THINGS TO OBSERVE**__
  * apearance
  * verbal behaviour
  * physical behaviour
  * personal space
  * people who stand out

__**THINGS TO NOTE**__
  * cloths, age, gender
  * actions, qualities, characteristics

//**watch for something in particular to the objective**//

===== Interview =====
Gain rich data from knowledgeable person. Ask respondent questions in a face-to-face situation. Interview schedules and questionnaires measure variables by gathering answers to questions.

Each question must be relevant to one of the variables being studied.

Avoid asking questions out of curiosity or out of scope of object/subject.

  - whom to interview?
  - outline topics of interview.
  - What questions to ask?
  - Draft interview framework.

Unstructured interviews - use reminders or key points to aid in keeping interview along the lines.

===== Case Studies =====

In-depth study of particular subject; might be unique or exceptional.

May study more than one case to draw comparison or generalizations, or build a theory.

Allows to learn more about little known situation; or subject that changes over time.

Does not ensure generalization. Case study requires extensive amount of time.

Case study involves the following:
  * organization of data;
  * categorization of data;
  * interpretation of instances (bit of data);
  * indentification of patterns;
  * synthesis & generalization - form overall picture.
==== 3 TYPES OF INTERVIEW ====
  - Unstructured: little standardization; improvise on correspondent's words meaning; conversation-like.
  - Structured: standardized (known Q, t, etc.); remain on topic; no improvisation; structured conversation; dialogue form; no deviations from Q; no interpretation of meaning.
  - Semi-structured: flexibility between the two.

===== Survey =====
Survey has to use neutral language; be clear; response categories have to be mutually exclusive & exhaustive (no overlap & all available choices).

**__Open-ended questions__**: respondent's answers are not limited; allows for greater range of answers. Disadvantage is that respondent may answer in more than one way. Open-ended questions are harder to compare between respondents.

**__Closed-ended question__**: respondent's answers are limited; can answer quickly; simplifies data entry and comparison. Response may be too simplified for the complex question; strict choices may alter oppinion or knowledge that did not initially exist (respondent change own mind).

__**Intensity Scales**__: measure how strong respondent feel/agree/disagree about the question.
  * 1-Directional: least to most (i.e. 1 -> 7)
  * 2-Directional: negative - neutral - positive
  * Matrix: sub-questions about the same question

**__Ranking Questions__**: ask respondent to put items in order of preference. Ex.: rank in order of importance. Do not ask to rank more than 5 items at once.

**__Worded Questions__**: never use always/never; avoid leading questions (that may bias the response).

Ask only relative questions; use appropriate level of measurement; be aware of sensitive information;

:?: **Filter and Branching Questions**
Ordering of items
Sections & numbers

==== Levels of Measurement ====
**__Nominal__**: categories; numerical values that are arbitrary. Ex.: age, gender, location.

**__Ordinal__**: order of values in list. Ex.: Rank

**__Interval__**:
